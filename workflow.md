### Justin's Current Workflow

This workflow is subject to change, but this is the path necessary to match the graphics creation.

NOTES:
* This is running via command line. This is introducing some env problems, like it still looks at `io.py` and does not see the CVDP module, but Python's. This will need to be addressed!
* The file saving is not ideal; the top level time series files are being written, but have issues reading them before calcs, however:
    - The climatologies are being checked, and are read in if exists, but the INDIVIDUAL calculations are still being done everytime in `AtmOcnGR.py`:
        * trends
            * NPI
            * EOF's (NAM, SAM, etc.)
        * ensemble means
        * etc.
* There is a certain amount of redundancy, especially in the calculations/file saving/adding attributes. This is a great area to start looking at streamlining.
* This workflow now creates global and polar plots for ensembles and ensemble averages for a subset of the desired plots. (See...)
* The code is there for multiple reference simulations and for reference runs to have ensemble members too, I just haven't tested this yet.
* Work on formatting for `indmem` plots; the reference (if it exists?) should be a single plot top row center, then the postage stamp plots in the rows below (up to 10 for each row) -  This asks the question, what if there are more than 10 references? -> keep the same logic for the simulations I guess...
* Need to add area averaged check for EOF outputs and add logic to get the same sign as reference EOFs.

* Calculations should be reviewed by Adam! -
    - are the EOF's looking ok?
    - Are the ensemble means being done correctly?
    - Area averaging and land masking good?

How to run:

1) activate CVDP development conda envrionment: `conda activate cvdp-dev` (must build first if haven't yet, see README.md)

2) Go to directory `cvdp`, and run: `python cli.py <directory for saved images>`, that's it.
    * or if using non default `example_config.yaml` file: `python cli.py -c <path to custom config yaml> <directory for saved images>`
    * ie `python cli.py -c /glade/work/richling/CVDP-python-dev/CVDP-python/test_config_yamls/example_config_no_ens_1_solo.yaml cvdp-output/`

* You can put `time` in front of the python call to get the time the script takes to run `time python cli.py ...`


This workflow has a rigid structure, rife with loops. Obviously this is speed-built code that could benefit from refactoring and could better thought out.


03/20206 Updates:
Refactoring `AtmOcnGR` into logical break points. This script is really doing four actions:
* Determining which plots are valid
* Gathering data
* Configuring plot dispatch
* Saving figures

Thus this refactored structure is:
graphics()
    ├── iterate_plot_space()
    ├── determine_case()
    ├── build_plot()
    │     ├── build_standard_plot()
    │     ├── build_npi_plot()
    │     └── build_eof_plot()
    └── save_figures()

This will also refactor `gather_data`; currently it is trying to do 5 jobs:
* Iterating runs
* Handling ensemble vs single-member logic
* Handling trends vs means
* Handling special analysis (NPI, EOF)
* Managing attrs + metadata

into:
gather_data()
    ├── process_run()
    │     ├── process_member()
    │     └── compute_analysis()

## Apr. 1st 2026 Updates:

Refactored code ALOT. Tried to group thing s a little more logically.

Basic overview of command line call:
testing example: 
```python
python cli.py -c test_config_yamls/example_config_4_ens_1_solo.yaml 4_ens_1_solo/
```

`cli.py`
3 main objectives here:
1) File I/O -> `file_io.get_input_data()`

    -> input(s) config yaml file ie `example_config.yaml`

    -> returns `ref_datasets`: list of xarray dataArrays
               `sim_datasets`: list of xarray dataArrays
               `config_dict`: dict chocked full of good meta and actaul data, probably needs some love
2) Loop over variables and create graphics
    2) a. -> `diag.AtmOcnMean.get_run_dict()`
        -> input(s) `vn`: variable name
                    `ref_names`
                    `sim_names`
                    `ref_datasets`
                    `sim_datasets`
                    `config_dict`
                    `kwargs`
        -> returns `kwargs`: dict of keyword args; probably needs some love. Combine with `config_dict`... No.
    2) b. -> `vis.AtmOcnGR.graphics()`
        -> input(s) `plot_loc`: str saved plot location
                    `plot_dict`: dict of plotting details
                    `kwargs`
        -> returns `plot_dict`: dict of delicious plot details (iterative process per variable)
3) Generate webpages -> `cvdp_utils.web.generate_webpages()`

2) b.
